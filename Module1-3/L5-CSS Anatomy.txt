Anatomy of CSS
==================

1. Selector
=============
   When we select something in CSS like paragraph (p) it is called selector
   selector can be ID, Class, Element

P {
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 23px;
}

Here P is a selector.
Here color, Font-size are property.
Here #fff, 23px are property values.

2. Declaration
===============
   Property + Value = Declaration
   ex: color: #fff together will be Declaration.
   

3. CSS Rule
==============
   
P {
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 23px;
}

This will be called css rule together.

4. The global scope of css is not a bug but it is a feature of css.
