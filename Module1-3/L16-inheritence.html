    <h1>Rule1</h1>
    Any thing related to typography will be tends to inherited by children.
    like font-size, font-family, text-decoration, color, text transform
    that why it's a common place to put lot of typographic rules on html or body.

    Note: Everything we see on the page is child of the html element, so they inherit those propeties, we can 
          override where we need to.

    Note: if there is browser default on certain property that won't be inherited, this could be anything that doesn't have
    default styling on it, e.g. Heading by default is bold and has font size so if u put font-size of 1.125 rem 
    on html my h1 will grow as well because it is relative unit is on there so it's not inheriting on the font
    size. e.g.2 Links they don't inherit the color because they have default color and text decoration on them.

    <h1>Rule 2</h1>
    Nothing related to Layout is inherited.
    e.g. Margin, Padding, Height, width, position ... etc is not inherited.

    <h1>Rule 3</h1>
    The following DO NOT inherit things like you would expect them to, this is because of browser default.
    e.g. button, input, textarea, select, optgroup or anything inside the form by default they don't 
    inherit anything, but we can make them inherit those properties if we would like.

    e.g 
    button, input, optgroup, select, textarea {
        font-family: inherit;
    }

    by this we can make them to inherit the FF u set as a default.

    sometimes u want the link color to be same as body text color

    a{
        color: inherit;
    }

    we want Only H1 bold but h2, h3, h4 as regular text then

    h2, h3, h4{
        font-weight: inherit;
    }

</body>
